## Book coverage (full product)

Coverage is not uniform. Here is what each book actually priced.

| Book | Quotes | Matches with a FT 1X2 close | Closing prices on |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Bet365 | 20,948,125 | 10,786 (97.0 %) | all 8 markets |
| Pinnacle | 1,601,791 | 8,243 (74.1 %) | 1X2, Asian handicap, total goals |
| Unibet | 1,913,638 | 9,757 (87.8 %) | 1X2, total goals |
| Betfair (Sportsbook) | 3,719,750 | 2,491 (22.4 %) | 1X2 |
| Betsson | 760,072 | 4,218 (37.9 %) | 1X2, total goals |

Split: **21,777,262 in-play** (75.2 %) · **7,166,114 pre-match** (24.8 %).

Markets: full-time 1X2, Asian handicap, total goals and total corners, and the same four for the
first half. Bookmakers are always named, never aggregated. The 37 other bookmakers are in
`Bookmaker_Snapshots`: their first and last pre-match snapshot, each with its time.

---

## Said plainly

Stated up front rather than discovered after paying.

- **Not collected for three tournaments:** UEFA European Championship 2020 has no Betfair or Betsson,
  FIFA World Cup 2018 no Pinnacle, Betfair or Betsson, FIFA World Cup 2022 no Betfair.
- **A closing quote is the last pre-match price recorded.** Median gap to kickoff on FT 1X2:
  Pinnacle 3 min, Betfair 5 min, Betsson 7 min, Bet365 23 min, Unibet 48 min. That is why every
  book has its own closing time.
- **The other bookmakers' table is a dated snapshot, not a closing price:** the source keeps three
  snapshots per book (first price, around kickoff, last price). Check `Minutes_Before_Kickoff`.
- **Lineups are almost absent from the source for the CAF Champions League** (0.1 % of matches).
- **Data starts on 2016-08-31:** Copa Sudamericana 2016, CAF Champions League 2016, CONCACAF
  Champions Cup 2016/17 and AFC Champions League 2016 are partial editions, listed in the README.
- **8 source events were removed** (duplicates, a match of another competition, isolated qualifiers),
  each listed with its evidence in `sample/README.md`. Results awarded after the match are kept as played.
- **Odds are UTC and come from one provider.** No cross-provider reconciliation is claimed.

## What in-play looks like, in this sample

Argentina 2-2 France, FIFA World Cup final, 18 December 2022. Bet365 full-time 1X2 (the 90-minute
market), in-play, around each goal. Every row is in `sample/odds_timestamped/Intl_Odds_Timestamped_WC_2022.csv.gz`.

| Timestamp (UTC) | Min | Score | Argentina | Draw | France |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|

144 in-play Bet365 1X2 quotes on this match alone, and 349 Pinnacle quotes before kickoff. The
Matches row carries the rest of the story: 2-2 after 90 minutes, 3-3 after extra time, 4-2 on
penalties, Neutral_Venue = 1.

```python
import pandas as pd

o = pd.read_csv("sample/odds_timestamped/Intl_Odds_Timestamped_WC_2022.csv.gz", dtype={"Match_ID": str})
live = o[(o.Match_ID == "6025486") & (o.Book == "Bet365") &
         (o.Market == "FT_1X2") & (o.Phase == "In-play")]
print(live[["Timestamp_UTC", "Minute", "Score_Home", "Score_Away",
            "Price_Home", "Price_Draw", "Price_Away", "Suspended"]].to_string())
```

## Eight tables, one key

Everything joins on `Match_ID`. No fuzzy name matching.

| File | One row per | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| `Intl_Matches.csv` / `.xlsx` | match | edition, stage, matchday, leg, kickoff, scores 90' / AET / penalties, aggregate, neutral venue, formations, managers, referee, venue |
| `Intl_Opening_Closing_Odds.csv` / `.xlsx` | match | open and close per book and market, each with its time |
| `odds_timestamped/` (18 × `.csv.gz`) | price update | book, market, phase, prices, line, score, clock, suspension, UTC, epoch |
| `bookmaker_snapshots/` (18 × `.csv.gz`) | snapshot | 37 more books: first and last pre-match snapshot, with minutes before kickoff |
| `Intl_Team_Stats.csv` / `.xlsx` | match × team | 29 metrics incl. xG |
| `lineups/` (18 × `.csv.gz`) | player × match | starters, subs, shirt, position |
| `events/` (18 × `.csv.gz`) | event | 13 event types with minute and player |
| `minute_stats/` (18 × `.csv.gz`) | stat × minute | running stats minute by minute |

The complete column dictionary, the editions and stages of every competition, the coverage tables and
the integrity notes are in `sample/README.md`, the README shipped with the product.

**Nothing a spreadsheet can reinterpret.** Scores, minutes and shoot-outs are separate integer
columns. Timestamps are full ISO 8601 with the T and the Z, plus an epoch. Formations are digits
(4231 = 4-2-3-1), so 4-4-2 never becomes 4 April 2002. Editions read 2016/17 or 2019. Every cell
was audited against Excel auto-conversion patterns at write time: zero risky cells. A closing price
is never an in-play price.
